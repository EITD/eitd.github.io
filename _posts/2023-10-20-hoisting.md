- Variables declared or intialized with the `var` keyword will have their **declaration** **“moved” up** to the top of their module/function-level scope, which we refer to as hoisting. However, only the declareation is hoisted, the **assignment** will **stay** where it is.

```jsx
console.log(foo); // undefined
var foo = 1;
console.log(foo); // 1
```

- Function **declarations** have the **body hoisted** while the function **expressions**(written in the form of variable declarations) only has the variable **declaration hoisted**.

```jsx
// Function Declaration
console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]
foo(); // 'FOOOOO'
function foo() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
}
console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]

// Function Expression
console.log(bar); // undefined
bar(); // Uncaught TypeError: bar is not a function
var bar = function () {
  console.log('BARRRR');
};
console.log(bar); // [Function: bar]
```

- Variables declared via `let` and `const` are **hoisted** as well. However, unlike `var` and `function`, the variable is in a **temporal dead zone**.

```jsx
x; // undefined
y; // Reference error: y is not defined

var x = 'local';
let y = 'local';
```

# Temporal dead zone(TDZ)

A `let` or `const` variable is said to be in a TDZ from the start of the block until code **execution reaches** the line where the variable is declared and intitialized.

While inside the TDZ, the variable has not been initialized with a value, and any attempt to access it will result in a `ReferenceError`. The variable is intitialized with a value when execution reaches the line of code where it was declared.
