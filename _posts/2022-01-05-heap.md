- **Max-Heap:**
    - In a Max-Heap the data element present at the root node must be the greatest among all the data elements present in the tree.
    - This property should be recursively true for all sub-trees of that binary tree.
- **Min-Heap:**
    - In a Min-Heap the data element present at the root node must be the smallest (or minimum) among all the data elements present in the tree.
    - This property should be recursively true for all sub-trees of that binary tree.

### Time Complexity

- Build heap：O（nlog n）
- Max/Min value：O（1）
- Insert/Delete：O（n）
