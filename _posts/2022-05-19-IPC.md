# Inter Process Communication

## Pipe

- Within **one** process or between **child and parent**.
- One process **write** into the pipe and the other **read** from the pipe.
- **Temporary** connection.


## Named Pipe (FIFO)

- A special kind of **file** on local storage
- Allow **two or more** processes to communicate by reading or writing from the file.

## Shared Memory

- Available for **multiple** processes to access.
- Need to be protected with **synchronization** when multiple processes communicate at same time.


## Message Queue

- Once a **message** is received by one process, it would be **no longer available** for any other processes.
- Process A wants to send **different data packets** to Process B, C and D.


## Semaphore

> To protect critical region shared by multiple processes.

- **Binary Semaphore**
    
    Only two states: 0/1, locked/unlocked, unavailable/available.
    
- **Counting Semaphore**
    
    Assume there are 3 services to be fetched and we use semaphore to control visibility of the loading icon. At first, semaphore is 0 and loading icon will appear. Every time we fetch data successfully, let semaphore plus 1. When semaphore reach 3, the loading icon will disappear.
    

## Signal

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ A notification to a process indicating the occurrence of an event. Also called **software interrupt**. E.g. SIGSTOP, SIGKILL
