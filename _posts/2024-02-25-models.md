Assumptions -> Timing + Failures

## Timing assumptions

**Processes**
Bounds on time to make a computation step
**Network**
Bounds on time to transmit a message between a sender and a receiver
**Clocks**
Lower and upper bounds on clock drift rate

## Failure assumptions

**Processes**
What kind of failure a process can exhibit?
Crashes and stops
Behaves arbitrary (Byzantine)
**Network**
Can a network channel drop messages?
Can certain channels temporarily disconnect? (partitions)

## Asynchronous system model

- No bound on time to deliver a message
- No bound on time to compute
- Clocks are not synchronized

> Consensus is non-solvable in asynchronous systems
> 

## Synchronous system

- Known bound on time to deliver a message (latency)
- Known bound on time to compute
- Known lower and upper bounds in physical clock drift rate

> Consensus is solvable in synchronous system with up to N-1 crashes
> 

## Partially synchronous system

- Initially system is asynchronous
- Eventually the system becomes synchronous (for a while)

> Consensus solvable in any partially synchronous system with up to N/2 crashes
> 

## Byzantine faults

Some processes might behave arbitrarily

- Sending wrong information
- Omit messagesâ€¦

Byzantine algorithms that tolerate such faults

- Only tolerate up to 1/3 Byzantine processes
- Non-Byzantine algorithms can often tolerate 1/2 nodes in the asynchronous model
