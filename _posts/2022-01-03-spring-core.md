# Benefits

- **Lightweight** – There is a slight overhead of using the framework in development.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)** – Spring **container** takes care of wiring dependencies of various objects instead of creating or looking for dependent objects.
- **IoC container** – manages Spring Bean life cycle and project-specific configurations
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** – Spring supports AOP to separate business logic from system services. It is a methodology that divides the program l**ogic into pieces** or parts or concerns.
- **MVC framework** – used to create web applications or **RESTful** web services, capable of returning XML/JSON responses
- **Transaction management** – reduces the amount of boilerplate code in JDBC operations, file uploading, etc., either by using **Java annotations** or by Spring Bean XML configuration file
- **Exception Handling** – Spring provides a convenient API for translating technology-specific exceptions into unchecked exceptions.
