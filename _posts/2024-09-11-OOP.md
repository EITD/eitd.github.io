## Object-oriented VS Process-oriented

- Process-oriented divides the problem-solving process into **methods** and solves the problem through the execution of methods one by one.
- Object-oriented abstracts **objects** and then solves the problem with the object execution methods, which is easier to **maintain, reuse and extend.**

## Object Entity VS Object Reference

- One entity can be referenced by many references, while one reference refers to 0 or 1 entity.
- **Object Equal** compares the content, while **Reference Equal** compares the memory address.

## Encapsulation

> **Hide** the properties and implementation details of objects and **expose** public access methods to external to **prevent** arbitrary access and modification of data.
> 

## Inherit

> Inherit the methods of the base class and make own extensions.
> 

## Polymorphism

> One interface, multiple implementations.
> 

**Example:**

```java
class Shape {
    void draw() {}
}
  
class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Circle.draw()");
    }
}
  
class Square extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Square.draw()");
    }
}
  
class Triangle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Triangle.draw()");
    }
}
```
