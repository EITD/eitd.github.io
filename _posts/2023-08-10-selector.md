# Specificity

If there are two or more declarations providing **different property** values for the **same element**, the declaration value in the style block having the matching selector with the greatest algorithmic weight gets applied.

## Selector weight categories

### ID column

ID selectors, such as `#example`. Add **1-0-0** to the weight value.

### CLASS column

class selectors, such as `.myClass`, attribute selectors like `[type=“radio”]` and pseudo-classes, such as `:hover`. Add **0-1-0** to the weight value.

### TYPE column

type selectors, such as `p` and pseudo-elements like `::before`. Add **0-0-1** to the weight value.

## Three-column comparison

The number of selector components in each column are compared, from **left to right**. If the competing selectors have the same values in all the three columns, the **last declared** style gets precedence.

# What elements match a selector

Browsers match selectors from **rightmost to left**. For example with this selector `p span`, browsers firstly find all the `<span>` elements and **traverse up its parent** all the way up to the root to find the `<p>` element. 

# Pseudo-elements

A keyword added to a selector that lets you **style a specific part** of the selected elements. For example, `:first-line` and `:first-letter` can be used to decorate text.
