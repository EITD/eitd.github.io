# Fix browser-specific styling issue

- **Distinctive** stylesheet for various browsers.
- Utilizing a **library** such as Bootstrap.
- Reset or normalize CSS.

## Reset and Normalize

- Resetting - strip all default browser styling on elements. **Redeclare** styling for common typographic elements.
- Normalizing - **preserves** useful default styles rather than unstyling everything.

# Serve feature-constrained browsers

- Graceful degradation - build for modern browsers while ensuring it **remains** **functional** in older browsers.
- Progressive enhancement - build for a **base level** of user experience, but **adding** functional **enhancements** when a browser supports it.
