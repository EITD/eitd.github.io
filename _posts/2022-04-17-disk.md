- **Seek Time**
    
    The time taken to locate the disk arm to a specified **track** where the data is to be read or write. 
    
- **Rotational Latency**
    
    The time taken by the desired sector of disk to **rotate** into a position so that it can access the read/write heads. 
    
- **Transfer Time**
    
    The time to **transfer the data**. It depends on the rotating speed of the disk and **number of bytes** to be transferred.
    

## Scheduling algrithm

### **FCFS**    

Advantages: 

- Every request gets a **fair** chance
- No indefinite postponement

Disadvantages: 

- Does **not** try to **optimize** seek time
- May not provide the best possible service

### **SSTF(Shortest Seek Time First)**    

Advantages: 

- **Average** Response Time **decreases**
- Throughput increases

Disadvantages: 

- Overhead to **calculate seek time in advance**
- Can cause **Starvation** for a request if it has higher seek time as compared to incoming requests
- High variance of response time as SSTF favors only some requests

### **SCAN(elevator algorithm)**    

Advantages: 

- High throughput
- Low variance of response time
- **Average** response time

Disadvantages: 

- **Long waiting time** for requests for locations **just visited** by disk arm

### CSCAN    

Advantages: 

- Provides **more uniform wait time** compared to SCAN
