| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PAN (Personal Area Network) | Let devices connect and communicate over the range of a person. E.g. connecting Bluetooth devices. |
| LAN (Local Area Network) | It is a privately owned network that operates within and nearby a single building like a home, office, or factory. |
| MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) | It connects and covers the whole city. E.g. TV Cable connection over the city |
| WAN (Wide Area Network) | It spans a large geographical area, often a country or continent. The Internet is the largest WAN. |
| GAN (Global Area Network) | It is also known as the Internet which connects the globe using satellites. The Internet is also called the Network of WANs. |

## Topology

### **Bus Topology**

- All the nodes are connected using the **central link** known as the bus.
- If the **main** cable **gets damaged**, it will damage the whole network.
- It is useful to connect **a smaller number** of devices.


### **Star Topology**

- All the nodes are connected to **one single node** known as the central node.
- If the **central node fails** the complete network is damaged.
- It is more **robust** and easy to **troubleshoot**.
- Mainly used **in home** and **office** networks.
        

### **Ring Topology**

- Each node is connected to exactly two nodes forming a **ring structure**
- If **one** of the nodes are **damaged**, it will damage the **whole** network
- It is used very **rarely** as it is **expensive** and **hard** to install and manage
        

### **Mesh Topology**

- Each node is **connected to one or many** nodes.
- It is **robust** as failure in one link only disconnects that node.
- It is **rarely** used and installation and management are **difficult**.
        

### **Tree Topology**

- A **combination of star and bus** topology also know as an extended bus topology.
- All the smaller star networks are connected to a single bus.
- If the main bus fails, the whole network is damaged.
        

### **Hybrid**

- It is a **combination of different topologies** to form a new topology.
- It helps to ignore the drawback of a particular topology and helps to pick
