## Data Structure

- `Queue`Â â€“ Use a **doubly-linked list**. The maximum **size** of the queue is determined by the cache size(the total number of available frames). The **least recently** used pages will be near the **rear** of the queue whereas the **most recently** used pages will be towards the **head** of the queue.
- `HashMap`Â â€“ Store the **page number** as the **key** along with the **address** of the corresponding queue node as the **value**.


## Algorithm

- After a **cache miss**:
    1. If cache is full, **delete** the **tail** of the list and **the reference** in HashMap.
    2. Add a **new element** in **front** of the list.
    3. Add a **new entry** inÂ HashMapÂ and refer to the **head** of the list.
- After a **cache hit**:
    1. **Remove the hit** element and **add** it in **front** of the list.
    2. **Update**Â HashMapÂ with a **new reference** to the **head** of the list.
