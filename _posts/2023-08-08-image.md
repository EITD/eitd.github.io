# Image sprites

> **Merge** numerous photos into a single large image.

- **Reduce** the number of HTTP **requests** for multiple images (only one single request is required per spritesheet).
- Advance downloading of assets that won't be downloaded until **needed**.

# Styling SVG

Basic coloring can be done by setting two attributes on the node: `fill` and `stroke`. `fill` sets the color inside the object and `stroke` sets the color of the line drawn around the object

```html
<rect
  x="10"
  y="10"
  width="100"
  height="100"
  stroke="blue"
  fill="purple"
  fill-opacity="0.5"
  stroke-opacity="0.8" />
```
