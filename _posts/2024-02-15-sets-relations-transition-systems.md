# **Partial Order (poset)**

A pair, a set and a relation (S, ≤) which, for any x and y in S is:

- Reflexive: x≤x
- Anti-symmetric: if x ≤ y and y ≤ x then x = y
- Transitive: if x ≤ y and y ≤ z then x ≤ z

# **Total Order**

A set and an relation (S, ≤) which, for any x and y in S is:

- Reflexive: x≤x
- Anti-symmetric: if x≤y and y≤x then x=y
- Transitive: if x≤y and y≤z then x≤z
- Dichotomy: either x≤y or y≤x
