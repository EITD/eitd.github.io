A promise is an object that may produce a single balue sometime in the future: either a resolved value or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved(e.g. a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.

The result of Promise can be set anytime because it has a **public setter** method. E.g. `CompletableFuture` and `SettableFuture`

```java
// You trick your mom into creating you a promise of eventual donation
Supplier<Integer> momsPurse = ()-> {

        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            ;
        }

        return 100;

    };

ExecutorService ex = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

// Mom's promise was created, but waited for some "completion" event
CompletableFuture<Integer> promise =  
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(momsPurse, ex);

// You created such event, announcing your plans to thank your mom
promise.thenAccept(u->System.out.println("Thank you mom for $" + u ));

// Mom started open her purse...but very slow...
// Father interfered much faster and completed the promise instead of your mom
promise.complete(10);
```

Output:

```bash
Thank you mom for $10
```

# Promise Vs Future

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Future is a **read-only** container for a result that does not exist yet, while a Promise can be **written**(normally once).

</aside>

## Future

> The result of the future will set by an asynchronous computation. FutureTask must be **initialized** since there is **no non-argument** constructor.

- Create a Future
    
    ```java
    public class SquareCalculator {    
        
        private ExecutorService executor 
          = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        
        public Future<Integer> calculate(Integer input) {        
            return executor.submit(() -> {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                return input * input;
            });
        }
    }
    ```
    
- Consume a Future
    
    ```java
    Future<Integer> future = new SquareCalculator().calculate(10);
    
    while(!future.isDone()) {
        System.out.println("Calculating...");
        Thread.sleep(300);
    }
    
    Integer result = future.get();
    
    /* Cancel code
     * boolean canceled = future.cancel(true); 
     */
    ```
    

# Promise Vs callback

## Advantages

- Avoid callback hell which can be unreadable.
- Write sequential asynchronous code that is readable withÂ `.then()`.
- Write parallel asynchronous code withÂ `Promise.all()`.
- With promises, these scenarios which are present in callbacks-only coding, will not happen:
    - Call the callback too early
    - Call the callback too late (or never)
    - Call the callback too few or too many times
    - Fail to pass along any necessary environment/parameters
    - Swallow any errors/exceptions that may happen

## Disadvantages

- Slightly more complex code.
- In older browsers where ES2015 is not supported, you need to load a polyfill in order to use it.
