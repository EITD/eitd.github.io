# computed Vs method

```html
<div id="app">
    <h2>{{getFullName}}</h2>
    <h2>{{getFullName}}</h2>
    <h2>{{getFullName}}</h2>
    <h2>{{getFullName}}</h2>
    <h2>{{fullName}}</h2>
    <h2>{{fullName}}</h2>
    <h2>{{fullName}}</h2>
    <h2>{{fullName}}</h2>
  </div>
```

```jsx
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.10/dist/vue.js"></script>
  <script>
    const app = new Vue({
      el:"#app",
      data:{
        firstName:"skt t1",
        lastName:"faker"
      },
      computed: {
        fullName(){
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName
        }
      },
      methods: {
        getFullName(){
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName
        }
      },
    })
  </script>
```

Computed property has **cache**. When `this.firstName + " " + this.lastName` stays unchanged, method calls **4** times and computed only calls **once**. When `firstName` changes, computed calls once but method still calls 4 times.

The computed attribute is within the Vue instance. Modifying **object ouside** Vue instance will **not cause rendering**. However, if you modify the object of the Vue computed attribute, **external object** will be rerendered.

# computed Vs watch

```jsx
computed: {
  total() {
    return this.price * this.quantity;
  }
}

watch: {
  quantity(val) {
    this.total = this.price * val;
  },
  price(val) {
    this.total = this.quantity * val;
  }
}
```

A watcher is basically a function that Vue automatically executes when the watched property changes. We would have to **add a third watcher** if the `total` property also depended on the `tax`. This is the main reason why it's a better idea to use a computed property instead.

Watchers are more powerful and allow us to perform **complex operations** such as **HTTP calls** or execute some asynchronous logic that wouldn't be possible with a computed property.

```jsx
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      actorId: null,
      movies: [],
    };
  },
  methods: {
    getMovies() {
      // http request
      axios.get(`movies/actor/${this.actorId}`)
      .then(resp => {
        this.movies = resp.data;
      });
    }
  },
  watch: {
    actorId(val) {
      if(val) this.getMovies();
    }
  }
}
```

Another use case for a watcher is when we need to watch a data property until it **reaches a specific value**, and only then do something.

```jsx
watch: {
  quantity(val) {
    if (val > this.stock) {
      this.error = true;
      this.errorMessage = `We only have ${this.stock} units`;
    }
  },
}
```
