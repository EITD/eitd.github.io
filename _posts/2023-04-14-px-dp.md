### px

> **Pixels** - corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. eg: 320px*480px
> 

### **in**

> **Inches** - based on the physical size of the screen.
> 

### dpi

> **Dots Per Inch** - ****the number of pixels contained in each inch of screen.

- For example, we have a device 2 inches wide and 3 inches high:
    - When the resolution is "320*480", the dpi is 160.
    - When the resolution is "640*960", the dpi is 320.
    
    > The higher the dpi, the better the screen will be displayed.
    > 

### dp/dip

> **Density independent Pixels** - an abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen.

- $px = dp * (dpi/160)$
    - For device with a resolution of 320*480 (i.e. 160 dpi), 160dp = 160px, the button accounts for half of the screen width.
    - For device with a resolution of 640*960 (i.e. 320 dpi), 160dp = 320px, the button accounts for half of the screen width.

### **sp**

> **Scaleable Pixels** - this is like the dp unit, but it is also scaled by the user's font size preference.
