## Full Binary Tree

> The layers of the binary tree is k, and the total number of nodes is (2^k) -1.
> 

## Completed Binary Tree

> **Except for the last layer**, the rest of the layers are full and the last layer is either full or missing several consecutive nodes on the right.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ When root is 0, if the parent node is i, then the left child node is 2i + 1, and the right child node is 2i + 2.

## Balanced Binary Tree

- It can be an empty tree.
- If it is not an empty tree, the absolute height difference between its left and right subtrees does **not exceed 1**, and the left and right subtrees are a balanced binary tree.

## Applications

- It's widely used in computer networks for storing routing table information.
- Decision Trees.


## B-Tree

The B Tree is a type of **m-way** tree that is commonly used for disc access. A B-Tree with order m can have at most **m children** and every node have **m/2 ~ m-1 keys**.


## Red Black Tree

1. Each node is red or black.
2. The **root** node is always **black**.
3. Each **leaf** node is a **black** empty node (NIL node).
4. If the node is **red**, its **child** node must be **black** (reversely not necessarily).
5. **Each path** from the root node to the leaf node or empty child node must contain the same number of black nodes (the **same black height**).
