ðŸ’¡ Inversion of Control: A design principle that allows classes to be loosely coupled and easier to test and maintain. IoC refers to transferring the control of objects and their dependencies from the main program to a container or framework.

# Dependency Injection

## **Without** dependency injection

We creates a dependency between theÂ `Client` and theÂ `ExamplieService`. We are instantiatingÂ `ExamplieService`Â every time we call `Client()`, which means theÂ `Client`Â class directly depends on theÂ `ExamplieService`Â class.

```java
public class Client {

private ExampleService service;

    Client() {
        service = new ExampleService();
    }
}
```

## **Constructor** Injection

We create an abstraction by having theÂ `ExamplieService` dependency class inÂ `Client`'s constructor signature (not initializing dependency in class). 

Constructor injection allows injecting values to **immutable** fields and makes **testing easier**.

```java
public class Client {

private ExampleService service;

    Client(Service service) {
        this.service = service;
    }
}
```

This allows us to call the dependency then pass it to the `Client` class like so:

```java
ExampleService service = new ExampleService(); // dependency
Client client = new Client(service);
```

## **Setter** Injection

```java
public void setService(Service service) {
		this.service = service;
}
```

## **Interface** Injection

```java
public interface ServiceSetter {
		public void setService(Service service);
}

public class Client implements ServiceSetter {
		private Service service;

		@Override
		public void setService(Service service) {
				this.service = service;
    }
}
```
