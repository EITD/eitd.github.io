# Software modeling

- A **model** is an abstraction describing a subset of a system
- A **view** depicts selected aspects of a model
- A **notation** is a set of graphical or textual rules for depicting views

# Concepts and Phenomena

## Phenomenon

– An object **in the world** of a domain as you perceive it

– Example: The lecture you are attending

## Concept

– Describes the properties of phenomena that are **common**.

– Example: Lectures in software engineering course

## Concept is a 3-tuple:

– Name (To distinguish it from other concepts)

– Purpose (Properties that determine if a phenomenon is a member of a concept)

– Members (The set of phenomena which are part of the concept)

# **Abstract Data Types and Classes**

- Abstract data type – Special type whose implementation is hidden from the rest of the system.
- Class – An abstraction in the context of object-oriented languages
- Like an abstract data type, a class encapsulates both state(variables) and behavior (methods)
- Unlike abstract data types, classes can be defined in terms of other classes using **inheritance**
- Unlike of classes, abstract data types may have **axioms/constraints on the values of their members**
- Abstract data type is rather **mathematical** notion while class is a **programming** notion

# UML

- Use case Diagrams
– Describe the functional behavior of the system as seen by the user.
- Organizational diagrams
– Packaging and components
- Class diagrams
– Describe the static structure of the system: Objects, Attributes, Associations
- Sequence diagrams
    
    – Describe the dynamic behavior between actors and the system and between objects of the system
    
- Communication diagrams
– Alternative presentation of sequence diagrams
- State diagrams
    
    – Describe the dynamic behavior of an individual object (essentially a finite state automaton)
    
- Activity Diagrams
    
    – Model the dynamic behavior of a system, in particular the workflow (essentially a flowchart)
    
- Component diagrams
– Show structure of components
- Deployment diagrams
– Used to model the hardware that will be used to implement the system

# Activity Diagrams

- An activity diagram is **a special case of a state chart diagram** in which states are activities (“functions”)
- Two types of states:
    
    – Action state:
    
    - **Cannot be decomposed** any further
    - Happens “instantaneously” with respect to the level of abstraction
    used in the model
    
    – Activity state:
    
    - **Can be decomposed** further
    - The activity is modeled by another activity diagram

## **State chart Diagram vs. Activity Diagram**

- State chart Diagram for Incident - (State: Attribute or Collection of Attributes of object of type Incident)
        
- Activity Diagram for Incident - (State: Operation or Collection of Operations)
