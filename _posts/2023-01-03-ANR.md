<aside>
ðŸ’¡ ANR(Application is Not Responding) is a dialog box that appears when the application is **not responding**.

</aside>

- This ANR dialog is displayed whenever the **main thread** within an application has been **unresponsive** for a long time under the following conditions:
    - When there is no response to an **input** event even **after 5 seconds**.
    - When a **broadcast receiver** has not completed its execution within **10 seconds**.
- **Avoid ANR**: Perform lengthy database or networking operations in **separate threads.**
