## Before JDK 1.8

`Array + LinkedList`

1. HashMap processes **key ⇒ hash value**.
2. Use hash value to **determine the location** where the current element is stored.
3. If there is an **element in the current position**, it determines whether the key of the element are the same:
    1. If it is the **same**, it will be directly **covered**.
    2. Otherwise it will be resolved through the **zipper method**.

> **Zipper Method**: Create an `Array`of `LinkedList`. If you encounter a hash conflict, just add the value to the end of linked list.

## After JDK 1.8

- When the length of the `LinkedList` > threshold (default is **8**), execute the `resize()` method to expand the array.
- When the length of the `LinkedList` ≥ **64**, convert to `RB Tree` to reduce the search time.
