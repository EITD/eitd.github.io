1. Use the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method to prevent **unnecessary re-renders**. This method allows you to control when a component should update based on its props and state.
2. Use the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects. This hook allows you to run side effects, such as **network requests**, after a component has rendered.
3. **Lazy loading**: Lazy loading is a technique where you only load the components that are needed for the current view. This can greatly improve the performance of your application.
4. **Code splitting**: Code splitting is a technique where you split your application into **smaller chunks** of code that are **loaded on demand**. This can greatly improve the performance of your application.
