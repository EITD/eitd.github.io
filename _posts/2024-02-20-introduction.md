## Consensus: agreeing on a number

All nodes/processes propose a value
Some nodes (non correct nodes) might crash & stop responding

The algorithm must ensure a set of properties(specification):

- All correct nodes eventually decide
- Every node decides the same
- Only decide on proposed values

## Atomic Broadcast

- A node broadcasts a message
- If sender correct, all correct nodes deliver msg
- All correct nodes deliver the same messages
- Messages delivered in the same order

## Atomic Broadcast â†” Consensus

- I. Atomic broadcast can be used to solve Consensus
    
    i.e., Every node broadcasts its proposal
    
    - Decide on the first received proposal
    - Messages received in same order
        - Thus, all nodes will decide the same value.
- II. Consensus can be used to solve Atomic broadcast
