### Atomicity

> All changes to data are performed as if they were a **single operation**. (Each transaction is treated as a single unit)
> 

### Consistency

> Data is in a **consistent** state when a **transaction starts** and when it ends.
> 

### Isolation

> The **intermediate state of transactions** is **invisible** to other transactions.
> 

### Durability

> After a **transaction successfully** completes, changes to data **persist** and are not undone, even in the event of systemic failure.
