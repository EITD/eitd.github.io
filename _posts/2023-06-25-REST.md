- 👩‍🔧 Client-server architecture
- 🔗 Resources exposed as URIs
- 📩 Uniform Interface
    
    Manipulate the resources with `create`, `get`, `update` and `delete` operations
    
- 📍 Stateless
    - No need to remember the client’s state between requests
    - Each request contains all information needed for the server to satisfy the request
