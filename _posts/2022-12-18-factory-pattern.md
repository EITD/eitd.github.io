ðŸ’¡ One of the best ways to create an object without exposing the creation logic to the client.

### Create a Factory

```kotlin
public class ShapeFactory {
	
   //use getShape method to get object of type shape 
   public Shape getShape(String shapeType){
      if(shapeType == null){
         return null;
      }		
      if(shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")){
         return new Circle();
         
      } else if(shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("RECTANGLE")){
         return new Rectangle();
         
      } else if(shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")){
         return new Square();
      }
      
      return null;
   }
}
```

### Use the Factory

```kotlin
public class FactoryPatternDemo {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();

      //get an object of Circle and call its draw method.
      Shape shape1 = shapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");

      //call draw method of Circle
      shape1.draw();

      //get an object of Rectangle and call its draw method.
      Shape shape2 = shapeFactory.getShape("RECTANGLE");

      //call draw method of Rectangle
      shape2.draw();

      //get an object of Square and call its draw method.
      Shape shape3 = shapeFactory.getShape("SQUARE");

      //call draw method of square
      shape3.draw();
   }
}
```
