# Reduce


### Two-Arg reduction

```java
T reduce(T identity,
         BinaryOperator<T> accumulator)
			   //（T, T) -> T
```

The identity value is "**accumulated**" with every T values
    
```java
T result = identity;   
for (T element : this stream)       
        result = accumulator.apply(result, element)   
return result;
```
    

### Three-Arg reduction

```java
<U> U reduce(U identity,
             BiFunction<U,? super T,U> accumulator,
				     //（U, T) -> U
             BinaryOperator<U> combiner)
             //（U, U) -> U
```

The combiner **combines** the multiple intermediate results of type U into a single result of type U
    
The intermediate values are of type U instead of type T because we have N threads reduce the T values in its segment into N intermediate values of type U.
